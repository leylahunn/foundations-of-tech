And when they were up they were up,
And when they were down they were down,
And when they were only half way up,
They were neither up nor down.
Needs a title

Oh the Duchess of Pork,
She had nine pigs.
She sprinted up to the top of the hill,
And she ate them.


But when they were down they were down,
And when they were only half way up...
they were neither the one nor t'other.

This is harder than it needs to be
Joshua Brett is awesome and the duchess of york knows it
