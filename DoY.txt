Needs a title

Oh the grand Duchess of Pork,
She had nine thousand pigs.
She marched them up to the top of the hill,
And she marched them down again.

And when they were up they were up...
But when they were down they were down,
And when they were only half way up...
they were neither the one nor t'other.
